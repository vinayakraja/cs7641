gatech user_name: vraja30

Data sources:

Github repo link : https://github.com/vinayakraja/cs7641/tree/main/assignment-3

Data: Telcom Customer Churn and product purchase propensity


Running code: 

The data is stored as CSV in data folder in the repo and has two Jupyter notebooks with corresponding analysis.

Jupyter-notebooks:
In this assignment, I have used ipython notebooks, clustering algorithms has one notebook and each dimensionality reduction algorithm has its own notebook.
1. Clustering algorithm: kmeans_em_clustering.ipynb
2. All DM algorithm implemnets neural network at the pottom have notebook name as algorithm name.

**All results and analysis already saved as cell output in these notebooks.

How to run:
1. Clone repository from github
2. I have added all dependencies in requirements.txt and added this in 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' in notebook
3. open Jupyter notebook in Python 3.7 environment:
     1. In order to re-create everything end to end click on CELLS and clink Run All ( this will take time as we do HP training for various algos) 
     2. in order to run individual code blocks, pressing shift + enter
