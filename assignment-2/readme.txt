Running code: 

The data is stored as CSV in data folder in the repo and has two Jupyter notebooks with corresponding analysis.

Jupyter-notebooks:
1. Neural_network_genetic_algo_optimization.ipynb - contains all analysis and models for finding weights using genetic algorithms 
2. Neural_network_RH_SA_optimization.ipynb - contains all analysis and models for finding weights using Random hill and Simulated Annealing. 

**All results and analysis already saved as cell output in these notebooks.

How to run:
1. Clone repository from github
2. I have added all dependencies in requirements.txt and added this in 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' in notebook
3. open Jupyter notebook in Python 3.7 environment:
     1. In order to re-create everything end to end click on CELLS and clink Run All ( this will take time as we do HP training for various algos) 
     2. in order to run individual code blocks, pressing shift + enter
