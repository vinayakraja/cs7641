Jupyter-notebooks:
In this assignment, I have used ipython notebooks, both problems are are part of separate notebooks with three  algorithms inside each notebook 
1. Frozen lake: Frozen_lake_pi_vi_q_learning.ipynb
2. Forest management: Mdp_tool_forest_mngmt_pi_vi_q_learning.ipynb

**All results and analysis already saved as cell output in these notebooks.

How to run:
1. Clone repository from github
2. I have added all dependencies in requirements.txt and added this in 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' in notebook
3. open Jupyter notebook in Python 3.7 environment:
     1. In order to re-create everything end to end click on CELLS and clink Run All ( this will take time as we do HP training for various algos) 
     2. in order to run individual code blocks, pressing shift + enter
